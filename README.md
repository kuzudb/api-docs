# API Docs
This repository hosts API documentation for Kùzu. The API docs are generated by a [CI pipeline](https://github.com/kuzudb/kuzu/actions/workflows/gen-docs.yml). The CI pipeline will automatically generate the docs from comments and create a pull request in this repository. To update API docs, please update the corresponding comments in [Kùzu repo](https://github.com/kuzudb/kuzu) and run "Generate-Docs" pipeline.
